# AI Receptionist for Patient Reports

## Overview

The AI Receptionist for Patient Reports is an innovative project aimed at streamlining the patient intake and reporting process in a healthcare setting. This AI system is designed to generate patient reports based on symptoms and input information while also labeling each patient report with its corresponding urgency level. The ultimate goal is to prioritize patients effectively and assist doctors in writing efficient reports.

## Features

### 1. Patient Symptom Analysis
- The AI Receptionist collects input information from patients, including symptoms and medical history.
- It analyzes the patient's input to identify potential health issues.

### 2. Report Generation
- Based on the collected information, the AI system generates comprehensive patient reports.
- Reports are structured to include relevant medical details and recommended actions.

### 3. Urgency Level Classification
- The system classifies each patient report with an urgency level based on symptom severity and medical history.
- Urgency levels help prioritize patients for quicker assessment.

### 4. Future Goals
- **Patient Scheduling:** The AI Receptionist aims to evolve into a system capable of creating patient schedules for doctors. It can efficiently allocate time slots based on the urgency of reports.
- **Assist in Report Writing:** The system will assist doctors in writing reports, saving time and ensuring completeness.

## Getting Started

To use the AI Receptionist for Patient Reports, follow these steps:

1. **Input Patient Information:** Enter patient information, including symptoms and medical history, into the system.

2. **Report Generation:** The AI system will process the data and generate a patient report.

3. **Urgency Label:** The report will be assigned an urgency label, indicating the priority level for the patient.

4. **Doctor's Review:** Doctors can review the generated reports and use them as a basis for diagnosis and treatment.
